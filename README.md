# Supreme_Bot

JavaScript is one of my favourite programming languages because of the many amazing things I can do with it, and one of them is building Google Chrome extensions. I created this extension as an auto fill/auto checkout service that the users can use on this specific website called Supreme. 

About Supreme, it is an American skateboarding lifestyle brand established in New York City in April 1994. The brand is targeted at skateboarding and hip hop cultures, and youth culture in general. Due to the brand name and the high demand for the weekly released items, it is nearly impossible for a customer to shop online without using a bot or a checkout service. 

The extension that I worked on could be considered as a bot since it knows how find the item that the users want, add it to the cart, and purchase it. However, the reason I learned how to build this was to learn about the very basic idea of web scraping and how a Google Chrome extension worked, and I did!
